# Number of simulations (1 million takes quite some time to run):
nsim = 1e6

# METHOD 1: 

# Initiating an empty matrix with each column representing a possible arrangement of the pencils:

m = matrix(0, 15, nsim)

# A double loop: the outer loop to move from one sample to the next along the simulations in the inner loop:

for (j in 1:nsim){
      pencils = c(rep(1,5),rep(2,5),rep(3,5))  # Blue is 1; Black is 2; Red is 3
      sam <- numeric(15)               # Starting an empty vector for simulation j
      sam[1] = sample(pencils, 1)      # We sample one of the pencils
      
    for (i in 2:length(pencils)){
        # We redifine the pencils available by taking out the first instance [1] of the color pencil that just showed up at i - 1:
      pencils <- pencils[ - which( pencils == sam[i - 1] )[1] ] 
        # Regardless of how many are left after the prior line for each color, we need to sample a different color from i - 1:
      remaining = pencils[ pencils != sam[i-1] ]
        # The following line is to sample one of the remaining colors:
      x <- ifelse(length(remaining) > 1, sample(remaining, 1), remaining)
      sam[ i ] <- x
 }
m[,j] <- sam
}

# There are NA's at the end of some experiments when two colors have been exhausted, forcing two pencils of the same color in the last
# two entries... So we remove them:

m = m[,colMeans(is.na(m)) == 0] 

# This is the number of unique arrangements:
ncol(unique(m, MARGIN=2))


# METHOD 2

# We define the pencils like in the prior method:

pencils = c(rep(1,5),rep(2,5),rep(3,5))
fun = function(){

# We sample the pencils...
      sam <- sample(pencils)
# And remove the first element from the sample
      sam.lag <- c(NA, sam[1:length(sam)-1])
      # Now we get rid of the NA and compare the sample to the sample offset by 1 entry to make sure that there are no 
      # consecutive repeat colors
          while(sum(sam == sam.lag, na.rm=T) > 0){
            sam <- sample(pencils)
            sam.lag <- c(NA, sam[1:length(sam)-1])
          }
    sam
}

# We use the formula:
m2 = replicate(nsim,fun())
ncol(unique(m2, MARGIN=2))


# In both cases the result is 7188.

# This is the same result as in the analytical answer:

# Just plug this into the entry line of Wolfram Alpha:

9!/(3!3!3!) - (3 choose 1)\frac{8!}{3!3!} + (3 choose 1)\frac{7!}{3!3!} + (3 choose 2)\frac{7!}{3!} - (3 choose 1)(2 choose 1)6!/3! - 6! + (3 choose 2)\frac{5!}{3!} + (3 choose 1)5! -(3 choose 2)4!+3!
